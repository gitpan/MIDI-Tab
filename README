NAME
    MIDI::Tab - generate MIDI music from ascii tablature

TO DO
    Try to make it so that from_guitar_tab etc can be called as a normal
    method or function call (instead of passing object as first parameter)

SYNOPSIS
      use MIDI::Tab;
      use MIDI::Simple;

      new_score;  # From MIDI::Simple

      my $drums = <<"EOF";

      SD:  ----8-------8-------8-------8---
      HH:  66--6-6-66--6-6-66--6-6-66--6-6-
      OHH: --6-------6-------6-------6-----

      my $bass = <<"EOF";

      EOF

      for(1..4){
          synch(  # From MIDI::Simple
              sub {
                  from_drum_tab($_[0], $drums, 'sn');
              },
              sub {
                  from_guitar_tab($_[0], $bass, 'sn');
              },
          )
      }

      write_score('demo.mid');  # From MIDI::Simple

DESCRIPTION
    MIDI::Tab allows you to create MIDI files from ascii tablature. It is
    designed to work alongside Sean M Burke's MIDI::Simple. There are
    currently three types of tablature supported:

    Drum Tab

    Each horizontal line represents a different drum, and time runs from
    left to right. Minus or plus characters represent rest intervals. As
    many or as few drums as required can be specified, each drum having a
    two or three letter code. Currently supported are: BD - Bass Drum, SD -
    Snare Drum, HH - Hi-Hat, OHH - Open Hi-Hat, CYM - Crash Cymbal. More can
    be added by writing to the hash %MIDI::Tab::drum_notes (see source for
    example). The numbers on the tablature represents the volume of the drum
    hit (from 1 to 9, where 9 is the loudest). Any parameters to
    from_drum_tab specified after the tablature string are passed to a call
    to 'noop' at the start of the tab rendering, so for example the length
    of each unit of time can be specified by passing a standard MIDI::Simple
    duration value (eg 'sn'). The channel that is used to play the drum
    notes can be changed by altering $MIDI::Tab::drum_channel (defaults to
    'c9').

    Guitar Tab

    Notes here are specified on an ascii representation of a guitar with
    each horizontal line of ascii characters representing one string on the
    guitar (as if the guitar were laid face-up in front of you). Time runs
    from left to right. You can 'tune' the guitar by specifying different
    root notes for the strings. These should be specified as a MIDI::Simple
    alphanumeric absolute note value (eg 'A2'). The numbers in the tablature
    represent the fret at which the note is played. Any parameters to
    from_guitar_tab specified after the tablature string are passed to a
    call to 'noop' at the start of the tab rendering, so for example the
    length of each unit of time can be specified by passing a standard
    MIDI::Simple duration value (eg 'sn') and the instrument can be selected
    (eg 'c3').

    Piano Tab

    Here, each horizonal line represents a different note on the piano and
    time runs from left to right.
